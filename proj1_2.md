# Project Outline: Softmax Kernel Optimization for LLM Inference

## 1. Project Definition  
- **Goal:** Optimize the softmax kernel within an LLM (Large Language Model) inference engine, demonstrating measurable performance gains and practical engineering craft.  
- **Scope:**  
  - Select an existing inference engine (e.g., llama.cpp, vLLM) and *one kernel* (the softmax step of attention)  
  - Profile baseline performance → implement fused/optimized softmax kernel → integrate optimized kernel → benchmark results  
  - Target GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) optimization (CUDA or equivalent) as primary backend  
- **Success criteria (metrics):**  
  - Clear reduction in latency or increase in throughput for the softmax kernel (e.g., ms → ms, tokens/sec)  
  - Profiling evidence: improved memory bandwidth utilization, reduced global memory accesses, better SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) occupancy  
  - Documented before vs after performance on multiple sequence lengths / batch sizes  

## 2. Foundations (Weeks 1-2)  
- Set up development environment (CUDA toolkit, profiling tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems)  
- Write and profile toy kernels (vector add, reduction, naive softmax)  
- Profile baseline inference engine: identify hotspot(s) → locate softmax in attention module  
- Deliverable: Document “Baseline measurement: hottest kernel(s), why they bottlenecked”

## 3. Implementation (Weeks 3-5)  
- Pick softmax kernel in the engine and extract/rewrite baseline version  
- Design & implement optimized version:  
  - Fuse passes (max-reduce, exponentiation, sum, normalize)  
  - Use shared memory, warp-level primitives, register reuse  
  - Ensure numerical stability (e.g., `exp(x - max(x))`)  
- Integrate optimized kernel into inference engine and test for correctness  
- Deliverable: Functional optimized kernel, integration test passed  

## 4. Validation & Benchmarking (Weeks 6-7)  
- Run benchmarks on multiple sequence lengths (e.g., 128, 512, 2048, 8192) and batch sizes  
- Collect metrics: latency per softmax call, memory bandwidth used, kernel execution time  
- Compare baseline vs optimized version: charts/tables showing improvement  
- Profile to verify improvements (e.g., reduced global memory loads, higher shared memory reuse)  
- Deliverable: Benchmark report with graphs + profiling logs  

## 5. Documentation & Portfolio (Weeks 8-10)  
- Write a technical blog post (~2000 words) covering:  
  1. Background & math of softmax in attention  
  2. Baseline kernel analysis  
  3. Optimization strategy and implementation  
  4. Benchmark results and trade-offs  
  5. Lessons learned  
- Publish GitHub repository: clean code, README, test harness, benchmark scripts  
- Optionally: Submit pull request to upstream project (even if not merged)  
- Deliverable: Repo link, blog post link, benchmark visuals  

## 6. Skills & Technologies Demonstrated  
- CUDA (or equivalent GPU kernel programming)  
- Profiling tools & performance measurement  
- Kernel optimization: memory hierarchy, warp/wavefront coordination  
- Numerical stability in algorithms (uses your math background)  
- Documenting and shipping engineering work  

## 7. Risks & Mitigations  
- **Risk:** GPU hardware too small or inaccessible  
  - Mitigation: Use cloud GPU (e.g., AWS/GCP), or target smaller sequence lengths  
- **Risk:** Kernel integration complexity in large codebase  
  - Mitigation: Scope to replace only the softmax within attention module; keep baseline handling intact  
- **Risk:** Limited performance gain  
  - Mitigation: Choose realistic baseline; optimize measurable hotspot; report accurately even if gain is modest  

## 8. Next Steps  
- Day 1-2: Install CUDA + drivers; compile and run simple GPU kernels  
- Day 3-5: Profile inference engine; locate softmax bottleneck; extract baseline measurement  
- Week 2: Review optimized softmax literature (e.g., tiling, fused kernels)  
- End of Week 2: Write baseline report and prepare kernel rewrite  
- Jump into Weeks 3-5 and follow the timeline above
