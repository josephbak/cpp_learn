# cpp_learn

## Overview
**cpp_learn** is a personal repository for reviewing and consolidating key concepts in C++ (C plus plus).  
It contains curated code examples and notes sourced from various learning materials, serving as a structured reference rather than original research or unique implementations.

## Objectives
- Summarize and reinforce fundamental and intermediate C++ (C plus plus) concepts.  
- Provide a concise technical reference for syntax, semantics, and best practices.  
- Maintain a clean and consistent codebase for ongoing review and experimentation.  
- Track progress while exploring modern C++ (C plus plus) standards and idioms.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josephbak/cpp_learn.git
   cd cpp_learn
   ```
2. Compile and run examples with your preferred compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++20 example.cpp -o example
   ./example
   ```
3. Browse the examples and adapt them as needed for study or experimentation.

## Requirements
- Modern C++ (C plus plus) compiler supporting at least C++17.  
- Basic familiarity with command-line compilation or use of an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  
- Optional: `cmake` for organized builds.

## Notes
Many code examples in this repository are derived or adapted from public tutorials, documentation, and textbooks.
